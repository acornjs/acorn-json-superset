# Subsume JSON support for Acorn

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-json-superset.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-json-superset)

Since Subsume JSON is part of ECMAScript 2019, acorn now supports it out of the box. Just make sure that you use acorn >= 5.6.0 and set ecmaVersion >= 10. This plugin is deprecated.
